Problem Statement
Given a sequence, find the length of its Longest Palindromic Subsequence (LPS). In a palindromic subsequence, elements read the same backward and forward.

A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

Example 1:

Input: "abdbca"
Output: 5
Explanation: LPS is "abdba".
Example 2:

Input: = "cddpd"
Output: 3
Explanation: LPS is "ddd".
Example 3:

Input: = "pqr"
Output: 1
Explanation: LPS could be "p", "q" or "r".
Constraints:

1 <= st.length <= 1000
sy consists only of lowercase English letters.
